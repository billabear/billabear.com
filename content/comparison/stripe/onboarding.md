When you first land on the Stripe page they’re main aim is to get you to sign up with a secondary goal of booking a call with their sales team. On every page you go to it’s very easy to see how to get started. It’s also very easy to see how to get in contact with sales if you want to do that.

During the sign-up phase, you’re asked for 4 pieces of information: email, full name, country, and password, as well as be asked to agree to terms and a privacy policy.

Once you’ve submitted, you’re asked to confirm your email. Nothing special or fancy. It’s very much a standard thing where you confirm email before you’re able to do anything further.


After you’ve confirmed your email you’re greeted with a page with two options. One option is to activate receiving payments. And the other option is to explore the features. When you choose to explore you only get to see a small sideshow of the various features that Stripe provides. Every time you choose to get started it’ll send you to activate receiving payments.

When you activate payments the first thing you need to do is provide the information for your business. What sort of business it is, where it’s based, tax number if it has one, and how long until the customer will receive the product they’ve paid for. The next step is to provide bank details for deposits. Then you have to enable a method for 2-factor authentication. It is not possible to have an active Stripe account without having 2-factor authentication enabled. It then tries to upsell you Stripe Tax.

Once you’ve activated payments you are then able to use the platform. However, you’re unable to make deposits until Stripe has reviewed your information. The review time is between 2-3 days. However, this doesn’t really affect you that much it takes several days for payments to be withdrawable in the first place.

There is no startup guide or onboarding process. You are greeted with 6 options for how to get up and running. The options are:

* Create a checkout page
* Manually charge a customer
* Invoice a customer
* Use a hosted payment UI
* Build a custom payment UI
* Charge customers in person.

Since Stripe is mainly a payment gateway with many features such as Stripe Billing. The onboarding process isn’t as smooth as others since it’s not as clear how you intend to use it as it is with other products.
