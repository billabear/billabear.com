When you go to the ChargeBee website the main thing it tries to do is to get you to book a demo to get you into the sales funnel. However, it is entirely possible to sign up for a free trial and even choose a paid plan without having to get on a call. You do this by either clicking “sign up for free” on the home page or clicking “sign up for free” on the pricing page under the starter column.

During the signup form process, you’re asked for 3 bits of information: email, phone number, and revenue. There is also a sort of hidden option where you can choose in which region your data is stored. This is important for many companies since they need to follow data privacy laws and that can demand your data is stored in certain areas.

Once you submit that you get told to check your email, I think they actually do some background logic to find out who your email provider is. I used a custom domain with Google Suite and it provided me a link to go back to Google Mail.

Once you confirm your email you then get to choose the name for your subdomain on Chargebee, the name of your account, and set your password. There is then some onboarding data collection such as finding out your goal and then they try to book an onboarding call. I didn’t do the onboarding call so I can’t say anything about it. But I can say that the calendar that was meant to load didn’t. I assume it got blocked by adblockers.

It sets up some sample data so you’re able to start playing around within the test account.

The first setup widget you have is to create a test plan with a price and then simulate a purchase using a modal to show you how a customer would be buying. I found this to be quite informative and reassuring as you find out quickly how the customer would go through the purchasing process and you see it for yourself.

There is then a setup guide in the sidebar, I found this rather hidden and not really something that jumped out at me. So I was originally left searching around the settings to try and figure stuff out before I spotted it. Once I spotted it and clicked on it, it was great and very useful.

During this setup stage, you create a plan and set the pricing. This is a quick and easy process with a slick UI. The plan creation and pricing will be gone over in finer detail later.

Then choose your payment gateway allowing you to choose between multiple. This means that you also have to go through another setup process to get started with ChargeBee. Connecting it to Stripe was as easy as using Stripe Connect clicking a button and logging into Stripe.

The options for integrating it start off with payment links that are defined and you just add a link. The next option suggested is using the javascript library where you add the JS library by copying the HTML given and pasting it into your HTML code. And then copying a buy now HTML to add a buy now link, as well as, a portal link. Lastly, it provides a link to API integrations.

Approximately 30 minutes after sign-up I got a phone call from Chargebee to find out my requirements. So they’re very hands-on with the signup process.

Overall, I would say the onboarding process for ChargeBee is very slick and impressive. It’s easy to use and doesn’t require a lot of technical knowledge. The ease of integrating it being as simple as adding a link or a few lines of HTML makes getting started really easy. While also providing a feeling of white-glove onboarding with onboarding calls and follow-up calls.
