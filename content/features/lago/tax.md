Lago Open Source handles tax calculation and if you buy the upsell it'll handle tax management for the EU.

Problems

* You still need to manage which tax rate you want/need to use
* Tax rates for places such as Quebec are unable to be added to the system. It has it to 2 decimal places which Quebec is 9.975 which is to three decimal places
* If you apply a tax rate to a customer you need to create a tax object instead of just entering a figure.
* Doesn't provide any information on tax that has been collected
